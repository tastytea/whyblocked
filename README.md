**Whyblocked** allows you to store the reason why you blocked someone, along
with "receipts", URLs to the posts that led you to block them.

It has a Qt-interface and uses an SQLite-database.

## Usage

Run `whyblocked`. You can also start it from the menu of your desktop
environment.

## Install

### Packages

Every [release](https://schlomp.space/tastytea/whyblocked/releases) includes
a .deb-package, an .rpm-package and a .tar.gz-package with precompiled binaries
for x86_64(amd64) ([more info](https://schlomp.space/tastytea/whyblocked/wiki/Binary-Packages)). These are automatically built and not tested. You can install
them with `dpkg -i` or `rpm -i`, respectively. The packages are signed with the
PGP key [242E5AC4DA587BF9](https://tastytea.de/tastytea_autosign.asc)
(Fingerprint: `F730 1ADF C9ED 2624 48C4  2B64 242E 5AC4 DA58 7BF9`).

Gentoo ebuilds are available via my
[repository](https://schlomp.space/tastytea/overlay).

a file [appropriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)
for the new language. If you want to translate to french for example, that file
name would be `whyblocked_fr.ts`.

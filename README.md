**Whyblocked** allows you to store the reason why you blocked someone, along with
"receipts", URLs to the posts that led you to block them.

It has a text- and a Qt-interface and uses a SQLite-database.

![Screenshot Qt interface](https://doc.schlomp.space/whyblocked/whyblocked_screenshot.png)

## Usage

For the text interface start `whyblocked`, for the Qt interface
`whyblocked-gui`. You can also start it from the menu of your desktop
environment.

## Install

### Packages

Every [release](https://schlomp.space/tastytea/whyblocked/releases) includes
a .deb-package, an .rpm-package, a .tar.gz-package and an AppImage with
precompiled binaries for x86_64(amd64). These are automatically built and not
tested. You can install them with `dpkg -i` or `rpm -i`, respectively. The packages are signed with the PGP key
